I'm antsy waiting for the phone to get delivered to me.

In the meantime I'm going to design a holder for it to hold the phone above a monitor using the dimensions of the original Pinephone.

The Pinephone Pro is a little bigger.

This is going to be my setup, will slow me down a little, I'm used to a big monitor/powerful desktop.

Look at that nasty yellow front-facing camera feed ha.

This keyboard is also not one of my favorites.

Display is HP 22cwa 21.5in 1080P

Unfortunately my original Pinephone's display is starting to come apart for some reason.

Trying to figure out what's a design that allows changing the angle. Probably a bump that you ratchet over.

Unfortunately the mount design will be unique to this monitor.

Luckily the back is just a flat slab.

15 mm monitor thickness, 7mm down

There is a lip/not flush on the front.

hard to tell how tall the lip is.

Nvm the edges are little warped here and there but it's essentially flush.

Look at me I'm being a good boy designing in mm

I'll put the design on Thingiverse too first one for me

0.5mm will be my offset/clearance/tolerance dimension

81 deg is the tilt towards me so I guess I'd just call it 80.

Maybe 20 deg increments is good enough.

I'm feeling lazy, won't even bother with adjustable rotation. Thing is I'm trying to avoid a screw of some kind.

You probably can design a compression-fit swivel joint thing.

Ugh... 3PM still waiting for it

I've gotten far in the design though.

Oh man this is a 5hr print

Concern is I have not checked if the fit is right.

So I'll probably cut a portion out to test print and see how it fits.

Like a tiny slice of the main cage dimensions

Ugh I'm just sitting here waiting for it because I don't want them to miss me and I have to drive like 20 miles to get it.

So for now I'll do some research. I'm also on the verge of falling asleep but I have to stay up until say 9 PM

I'll spend tomorrow to develop the app, I'll start researching today but I'm already spent though mentally been up for 11 hours already

# Software

OS is Manjaro with Plasma Mobile for UI

Yeah it's probably going to take me a bit to develop this app.

Like I have no idea what manjaro is.
