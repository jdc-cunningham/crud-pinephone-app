I'm so annoyed with DHL right now.

They keep failing to deliver this phone to me.

I pick a drop off point, it no longer exists.

Pick another one, they can't find it.

Now I'm sending it back to the original problem (my address) and it's going to fail again.

Like JFC what am I supposed to do.

Just f throw it away f me.

And of course the outsourced help is no better/can't help you as they just repeat the script of the site/what I would have chosen (happened).
